# Credit_risk_data
**Project Objective**: The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a credit card client defaulting on their payments in the next month. The model will use demographic data, repayment history, and financial details to generate accurate predictions that can assist financial institutions in managing credit risks more effectively.

**Background**: This dataset contains information on credit card clients in Taiwan from April to September 2005. It includes various features such as demographic details (age, gender), credit information (credit limit), and payment histories. The goal of this project is to predict whether a client will default on their credit card payment in the subsequent month. This project is aimed at providing insights that can assist financial institutions in mitigating risks associated with credit defaults.

**Goal**: The goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts if a client will default on their credit payment. The model will consider features such as credit limit, payment history, and demographic information, to generate risk scores for each client, thereby helping financial institutions make informed decisions.

## Number of Resources
- **People**: One data scientist (for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation)
- **Tools**: Python, Google Colab, libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`
- **Data**: Credit card payment dataset (Taiwan)
- **Hardware**: Computer with internet access, cloud computing (Google Colab)

## Business Impact
This project will help financial institutions make better data-driven decisions regarding credit card payments by predicting which clients are at risk of defaulting. By identifying high-risk clients early, financial institutions can take preventative actions, such as adjusting credit limits or offering payment plans. The business impact includes:
- **Improved Risk Management**: Identifying high-risk clients in advance can help reduce defaults.
- **Cost Savings**: Preventing defaults by proactively managing high-risk clients.      
- **Customer Retention**: Offering early interventions to at-risk customers to retain them.
